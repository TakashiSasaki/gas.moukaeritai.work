# Google Apps Script Project Management

This repository backs up and version-controls multiple Google Apps Script projects in one Git repository.

各 Google Apps Script project は `projects/<SCRIPT_ID>/` に配置され、Script ID を directory name として使用します。

## Repository Model

The repository separates synchronization responsibilities explicitly:

- `automation/`: synchronization implementation — **how** state is observed and synchronized.
- `data/`: external observations — **what** was observed, including Drive inventory snapshots.
- `projects/`: materialized Apps Script project source and metadata.
- `docs/`: the public GitHub Pages projection, including generated `projects.json`.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The default branch is `gas.moukaeritai.work`.

### Stage 1: Drive inventory

Workflow: `.github/workflows/stage-1-inventory.yml`

- **Trigger:** every three hours or manual dispatch.
- **Purpose:** observe Apps Script projects through Drive API, reconcile canonical project registry metadata and lifecycle, and regenerate the public project index.
- **Pipeline:**
  1. `automation/stage-1-inventory/fetch-drive-inventory.py`
  2. `automation/stage-1-inventory/reconcile-project-registry.py`
  3. `automation/stage-1-inventory/generate-public-project-index.py`
  4. repository validation
- **Outputs:** Drive snapshots under `data/inventory/drive-api/snapshots/`, `projects/<SCRIPT_ID>/` registry state, and `docs/projects.json`.

Stage 1 is the authority for Drive-derived project presence. `metadata.json` records this as `lifecycle.driveInventory`:

- `present`: the project exists in the latest Drive inventory and participates in normal publication/synchronization.
- `absent`: the project is missing from the latest Drive inventory. The canonical project directory and source history are retained, but the project is excluded from `docs/projects.json` and normal downstream synchronization. A later Drive observation can return it to `present`.

An `absent` transition is therefore **not** a project deletion.

### Stage 2 + Stage 3: Apps Script synchronization

Workflow: `.github/workflows/stage-2-3-sync.yml`

- **Trigger:** manual dispatch or successful completion of the Stage 1 workflow.
- **Stage 2 — inspection/planning:** `automation/stage-2-inspection/plan-materialization.py` observes structured Apps Script project/file/deployment/version state through the Apps Script API and emits a deterministic plan without mutating canonical project state or invoking clasp.
- **Stage 3 — materialization/finalization:** `automation/stage-3-materialization/materialize.py` consumes that plan, pulls only projects requiring source materialization, validates the resulting tree, finalizes structured observations, and advances successful-materialization checkpoints transactionally.
- **Validation:** repository structural validation runs after Stage 3 and before any commit.
- **Publication:** only `projects/` changes produced by a successful Stage 3 run are committed by this workflow.

`clasp pull` is the only steady-state clasp command. Node.js and clasp are installed only when the Stage 2 plan reports that source materialization is required. Stage 3 still runs when zero pulls are required because unchanged active projects may need their structured Apps Script observations finalized.

Stage 1 and the Stage 2/3 workflow share a repository-writer concurrency group. This serializes their default-branch mutations so a Stage 2 plan and its Stage 3 application are not raced by another canonical project-state writer.

Remote observation and successful source materialization are separate states. `appsScriptApi.updateTime` records observed Apps Script state, while `syncState.lastMaterializedAppsScriptUpdateTime` is the successful-materialization checkpoint used for source freshness. A failed source pull or failed Stage 3 transaction must not advance that checkpoint.

Stage 3 also rejects a plan if a concrete current Drive lifecycle or successful-materialization checkpoint no longer matches the state observed when Stage 2 built the plan.

### Validation

Workflow: `.github/workflows/validate-automation.yml`

Pull requests are checked with repository structural validation and unit tests under `automation/tests/` without requiring Google credentials.

## Project State

Each tracked project normally contains:

- `.clasp.json` with its Script ID;
- `metadata.json` with namespaced metadata such as `driveApi`, `appsScriptApi`, `lifecycle`, and `syncState`;
- Apps Script source files materialized by the synchronization pipeline.

The repository intentionally distinguishes three concepts:

1. Drive observation (`driveApi` and `lifecycle.driveInventory`);
2. Apps Script remote observation (`appsScriptApi` and related remote metadata);
3. successful materialization (`syncState.lastMaterializedAppsScriptUpdateTime`).

Historical metadata/file migrations are explicit maintenance operations under `automation/maintenance/`; they are not part of recurring Stage 1 synchronization.
